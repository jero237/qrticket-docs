We're building https://qrticket.app user guide with Mintlify.

You're in charge of that task.

Your job is to build, page by page, a user guide for non tech users on how to use the platform.

For that, I've scrapped the entire site and stored the html results into crawler/storage/datasets folder. This folder containts json files with the following fields:

{
"title": title of the scrapped page
"url": url of the scrapped page,
"timestamp": timestamp of the scrapping,
"html": html contents of the page, sanitized and cleaned up of non useful data
}

These files are indexed, so you need to grep them using keywords to learn how qrticket works and build the user guide.

If a screenshot is suitable, add [image: image description] so I can manually add it to improve docs.

Follow the structure given in docs.json, creating the .mdx corresponding files.

It should be written in argentininan spanish tone, without over expressing.

When creating new docs, grep the already existing ones to follow the same structure.
